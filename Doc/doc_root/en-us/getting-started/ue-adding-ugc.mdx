# Adding UGC

There are a few ways to allow users to add their UGC creations to your game. You can either let users build and submit UGC from inside your game, or you could take advantage of Unreal Engine's built-in tooling.

This guide covers:

* [In-game UGC submissions](#in-game-ugc-submissions)
* [Unreal Engine Creation & Upload Tool](#mod-creation--upload-tool)

## In-game UGC submissions

Submitting UGC from inside your game and making it visible to other players involves two steps:

1. Submitting new UGC
2. Submitting the data of the UGC (aka "the mod file")

These steps are outlined below. UGC can also be edited after submission, which you can learn via the [API Reference](/unreal/refdocs).

### Submitting new UGC

To submit a piece of UGC, you must first create a mod handle using [`GetModCreationHandle`](/unreal/refdocs#getmodcreationhandle), and use that handle when calling [`SubmitNewModAsync`](/unreal/refdocs#submitnewmodasync). Note that newly created UGC will remain hidden until a mod file is added in the next step.

{
	if (UModioSubsystem* Subsystem = GEngine->GetEngineSubsystem<UModioSubsystem>())
	{
		FModioModCreationHandle Handle = Subsystem->GetModCreationHandle();

		FModioCreateModParams Params;
		Params.Name = TEXT("My Amazing Mod");
		Params.Description = TEXT("This mod does amazing things");
		Params.PathToLogoFile = TEXT("C:\\path\\to\\image.png");

		Subsystem->SubmitNewModAsync(Handle, Params, FOnSubmitNewModDelegateFast::CreateUObject(this, &UModioManagerSubsystem::OnSubmitNewModComplete));
	}
}

void UModioManagerSubsystem::OnSubmitNewModComplete(FModioErrorCode ErrorCode, TOptional<FModioModID> ModId)
{
	if (!ErrorCode)
	{
		// Mod was successfully submitted 
		// We can now call SubmitNewModFileForMod with this ModId
	}
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Submitting the data for the UGC

Once you have successfully submitted a piece of UGC, you can submit a mod file for that UGC using [`SubmitNewModFileForMod`](/unreal/refdocs#submitnewmodfileformod). When you submit a mod file, you pass a [`ModioCreateModFileParams`](/unreal/refdocs#modiocreatemodfileparams) containing the directory containing all the files that you want to submit. The plugin will compress this folder into a .zip file and upload it as the active version of the UGC. 

In the future, if the mod is updated and requires a new mod file, `SubmitNewModFileForMod` can be called again. The most recent mod file uploaded by `SubmitNewModFileForMod` will be set as the active version. 

:::note
There is no callback for `SubmitNewModFileForMod`; you’ll be notified of the completed upload by your [**mod management callback**](/unreal/subscribing#installation-management).

  <TabItem value="blueprint" label="Blueprint">

After the callback for submitting UGC has completed, you can get the Mod Id to use for file submission.

{
	if (UModioSubsystem* Subsystem = GEngine->GetEngineSubsystem<UModioSubsystem>())
	{
		FModioCreateModFileParams Params;
		Params.PathToModRootDirectory = TEXT("C:\\path\\to\\mod-folder");
		Subsystem->SubmitNewModFileForMod(ModId, Params);
	}
}
```

## Mod Creation & Upload Tool

The mod.io Unreal Engine plugin includes an integrated editor module that provides a comprehensive Content Creation and Upload Tool for seamless mod management.
