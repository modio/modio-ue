# UGC Best Practices

Now you have set up the mod.io fundamentals within your game, understanding UGC loading and best practices will help you get the most out of the Unreal Engine Plugin. 

This guide covers:

* [UGC Content Types](#ugc-content-types)
* [Packaging](#ugc-packaging)
* [Loading](#ugc-loading)
* [Creation Tools](#ugc-creation-tools)
* [Cross-Platform Compliance](#cross-platform-compliance)
* [Next steps](#next-steps)

## UGC Content Types

### Generic Data Types
Unreal Engine supports loading non-Unreal specific data formats (i.e., non-uassets) at runtime, such as JSON, PNG, CSV, etc. Unreal also has various “Interchange” modules that can process more complex source assets at runtime (such as FBX, UDatasmith, etc). If your game is suitable for using this sort of data for UGC creation—for instance, describing behavior or level layouts via JSON blobs or replacing textures or icons from PNG files—then you can go this route instead of having to worry about Unreal-specific PAK files and managing the cooking and packaging process.

### PAK Files
PAK files are an engine-standard way of packaging and distributing all of Unreal's specific functionality and content. This means that you can load any sort of UAsset type (Blueprints, StaticMeshes, AnimationSequences, etc.) that the engine supports at runtime.

In order for your game to support this, you should keep the following in mind when structuring your content:
- Avoid hard references
- Make use of primary asset types
- Resolve content references from the asset registry

For example, when spawning a component within an Actor in C++, rather than referencing a StaticClass directly, it is preferable to use a blueprint-exposed `TSubclassOf` so that modders can change the asset that is spawned.

## UGC Packaging

### Generic Data Types
If you are using generic data types for your mods, then no additional work is needed to package and distribute this content.

When you use the mod.io Plugin or tools to submit mods, the folder containing all of the content is zipped for you and extracted once the file is downloaded. We recommend using a manifest file to structure the content references. One of the major benefits of this approach is that it is not necessary to cook the mod prior to distribution.

### PAK Files
PAK files can be thought of as UE-specific archive files or, in other words, a packaged collection of UAssets. They are generated by `UnrealPak.exe` located in `...\UE_version\Engine\Binaries\Win64`. Generally speaking, it’s not necessary to run this directly, as the editor provides a few ways to generate them through a wizard that will invoke UnrealPak for you.

See below an example command to extract a pak file:

```shell
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.1\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealPak.exe" "C:\Game\MyPakFile.pak" -Extract "C:\Users\My_Username\Desktop\Unpack"
```

The easiest way to package/cook a mod into a pak file is to create a plugin that contains all the mod’s data. Then it is possible to invoke UnrealPak using the DLC cooker, such as via the Project Launcher that comes with every modern vanilla UE. Note that the mod would need to be cooked for every platform intended for release, unlike the Generic Data Type approach.

## UGC Loading

### Generic Data Types
This kind of mod can be loaded in through UE’s built-in file IO layer to directly load and access the data required. In cases of raw assets, UE exposes most editor tools for asset importing, which allows runtime importing of supported asset types. This includes textures, FBX, and datasmith, all of which can be imported at runtime using Interchange, though there are other modules available to achieve this as well.

### ModioUGC
[ModioUGC](/unreal/modio-ugc) is a module for our Unreal Plugin that facilitates .pak file loading and unloading for Unreal Engine projects and is our recommended method. It's a drop-in solution for Unreal Engine that allows you to easily integrate user-generated content into your game, enabling dynamic UGC management in the form of PAK files.

### PAK Files
PAK files can also be loaded by mounting them at runtime, either statically in cases of standalone base game content/DLC, or dynamically in the case of mods.

In a packaged build, you can only mount pak files that contain cooked content. Just using UnrealPak to put a bunch of `.uasset` files in a pak file won’t work unless the content was cooked by the Editor for the platform being used.

The PAK file in question can be loaded based on its creation method. If it was created through DLC cooking and each asset has a matching entry in the `AssetRegistry.bin` within the PAK archive, then typically you can include it dynamically into your game by mounting the pak file and registering a mount point.

Once you mount pak files, they can be referenced as normal paths like any other content. In order to load them, you could query the asset registry, look up replacement actor references as part of your `Spawn` method, or use any other custom logic to load the content.

## UGC Creation Tools

### In-Game creation tools
Limited to generic data types as UnrealPak is not available in packaged games, nor is it redistributable under the standard UE license. This sort of approach would be common for things such as placing meshes or actors in a level and then exporting them as a JSON file. Your mod loading implementation would then read this JSON file and spawn all of these actors.

### Standalone Vanilla UE Editor
This is the minimal effort mod tooling solution while providing reasonable flexibility. To interface with base game content, some form of reparenting/remapping would be necessary. A potential solution to avoid that would be using gameplay tags to interface over a global message bus (see `UGameplayMessageSubsystem` in the `GameplayMessageRouter` plugin from the Lyra sample game).

### Vanilla editor with UGC tool kit
The addition of a UGC tool kit/plugin allows improved interfacing with the base game content over a vanilla editor without any supplementary content.

Example UE5 game: **Torque Drift 2** (Greasemonkey Games) modding is created using the UE5 vanilla editor and supplementary tools and files provided by the developer. Their focus is on track creation and sharing. Submission from the UE5 editor with mod tool kit is direct to mod.io. Supplementary mod kit is authored by the studio for use by the modding community.

Example UE4 game: **Ready or Not** (VOID Interactive) modding is documented in a series of guides created by modders and shared with the studio for feedback and input. The mod kit and process are owned and driven by the modding community.

### Dedicated editor Unreal
This option allows the maximum interfacing with the base game content and requires a cooked DDC. Based on the type of game, a creative way to strip back specific content must be devised to make the game unplayable within the mod editor while still allowing modders to mod the game as much as possible.

Example game: **Homeworld 3** (Black Bird Interactive/Gearbox) modding is created via a studio-authored and released version of their dev tools. Releasing a public editor tool requires approval from Epic Games and is published in Addons (Epic Game Store).

## Cross-platform compliance

### PAK Files
Each PAK file should correspond to its respective platform, so if you intend to support multiple platforms, you must cook and package the plugin's content for each target platform.

:::note
You cannot distribute console tools to your creators, as these tools are under NDA. For console UGC, you must cook and package the content yourself, or use a cloud cooking solution such as [mod.io Cloud Cooking](https://docs.mod.io/cloud-cooking).

### ‘Dos and Don’ts’
- **Do**: Utilize mod.io functionality that allows the game to sync mod collections on a subscribe function, checking the player’s collection and providing the means to enable and disable mods for a play session.
- **Don’t**: Rely on exiting and restarting the application to enable mods subscribed to by a player

- **Do**: Load content dynamically using the built-in `QueryUserInstallations` method to get the paths for each piece of content the user has installed
- **Don’t**: Rely on the engine's auto-loading behavior or leveraging the Mods directory to load content, as these directories are not accessible on consoles and present additional challenges around file locking for uninstalling and updating content

## Next steps

### Continue setting up the fundamental functions

If you haven't already, we recommend working your way through the [Unreal Getting Started Guides](/unreal#unreal-engine-core-plugin-guides) as they will teach you how to implement the fundamentals of the Unreal Engine Plugin such as content searching & filtering, subscription management and more.
