## Setup

The mod.io Unreal Engine Plugin supports in-game integration of the mod.io Marketplace - exposing the data and functions required to build a UGC store in-game.

The mod.io monetization features are need to be enabled through the web UI and, if selling the virtual currency through a platform store, will need a service to consume the virtual currency entitlements and apply them to player's mod.io account.

## Implementation
Marketplace functionality is accessible via the mod.io Subsystem along with all other functionality and as Blueprint nodes. Functions specific to monetization include:

- `GetUserWalletBalanceAsync`
- `FetchUserPurchasesAsync`
- `PurchaseModAsync`
