The mod.io UE plugin includes some basic profiling and metrics that can be viewed and exposed via Unrealâ€™s `stat` commands and via Unreal Insights. Profiling via the `MODIO_ENABLE_PROFILING` and `MODIO_UNREAL_PROFILING_SUPPORT` macros are enabled by default in the mod.io plugin for non-shipping builds.

## Showing Captured Data

The plugin includes two stat groups that can be shown: `Modio` (accessed via `stat modio`) and ModioScoped (async operations profiled for access via Unreal Insights).
* `Modio` includes some basic counters, such as the length of various background queues that process API requests and downloads.
* `ModioScoped` captures performance insights for a majority of the async operations that the plugin performs. This data is not suitable for showing in realtime via a `stat` command, however it is captured when creating stat profiles for use in Unreal Insights.
