== Profiling 

The mod.io UE plugin includes some basic profiling and metrics that can be viewed and exposed via Unreal's `stat` commands and via Unreal Insights. Profiling via the MODIO_ENABLE_PROFILING and MODIO_UNREAL_PROFILING_SUPPORT macros are enabled by default in the mod.io plugin for non-Shipping builds.

== Showing Captured Data

The plugin includes two stat groups that can be shown: Modio (accessed via `stat modio`) and ModioScoped (async operations profiled for access via Unreal Insights).
* Modio includes some basic counters, such as the length of various background queues that process API Requests and Downloads
* ModioScoped captures performance insights for a majority of the async operations that the SDK performs. This data is not suitable for showing in realtime via a `stat` command, however it is captured when creating stat profiles for use in Unreal Insights.
