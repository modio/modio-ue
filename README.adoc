Welcome to the mod.io Unreal Engine plugin repository. It allows game developers to host and automatically install user-created mods in their Unreal Engine games. It provides a UI for mod discovery, installation and collection management, and a C++ and Blueprint interface around the mod.io SDK, which connects to the https://docs.mod.io[mod.io REST API].

+
In the directory with your .uproject file: `git submodule add https://github.com/modio/modio-ue Plugins/Modio`

NOTE: The automatically generated zips in on the release page, or the 'Code' dropdown here, will not work! They do not contain our submodule dependencies. 

=== Enabling the plugin

Start the editor, then enable the plugin in the Unreal Engine settings:

image::Doc/img/plugin_window.png[]

Once this is done, you can configure the plugin and get started.

=== Plugin Configuration

The plugin requires some configuration information to behave correctly. You can access the configuration settings in the Project Settings window:

image::Doc/img/plugin_settings.png[]

The settings have the following parameters:

[.stretch,stripes=odd,frame=none, cols="25%,~"]
|===
|[.paramname]#Game Id#|Your mod.io-provided Game Id for the target environment
|[.paramname]#API Key#|Your mod.io-provided API key for the target environment
|[.paramname]#Environment#|Your current environment, Live or Test
|[.paramname]#Log Level#|The default logging level to use. Messages with a lower log level will be silently discarded.
|[.paramname]#Portal#|The default portal to use. This usually corresponds to the store your game will be being distributed through.
|[.paramname]#Use Background Thread#|Run the mod.io plugin on a managed background thread.
|===

NOTE: The Test environment is available for usage in limited circumstances. All games should be setup on the Live environment. If you require access to Test, please contact us.

=== Setting up your game

Before release, you will be able to setup a "hidden" Live environment that will allow you to perform QA against the production environment before release, without exposing your title to the public. At this stage, only selected accounts are able to see your game page, and mods that are uploaded for your title. Once you are ready, you can change the state from "hidden" to "public" to make a full release of your gameâ€™s modding capabilities.

== Further reading

To begin using the Plugin, either from Blueprint or from C++, please read our https://docs.mod.io/unreal/[Getting Started Guide] for a detailed explanation of initialization and usage.
